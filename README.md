End-to-end ML pipeline to forecast retail weekly sales using XGBoost, Random Forest, and ensemble modeling

# Retail Sales Forecasting – Machine Learning Project

This project builds an end-to-end ML pipeline to forecast weekly sales for 45 stores and 81 departments using historical retail data. The model uses feature engineering, time-aware cross-validation, XGBoost, and ensemble learning.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- XGBoost, Random Forest, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Project Highlights
- Engineered time-based and categorical features
- Used TimeSeriesSplit for validation
- Tuned models using RandomizedSearchCV
- Achieved RMSE ≈ 11,501 with XGBoost
- Delivered predictions for 115K+ test records

## 📁 Files Included
- `SupplyChain_Project.ipynb` – Full notebook
- features, stores, test, train - Datasets used
- `final_sales_prediction` - final prediction of sales
